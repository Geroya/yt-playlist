# yt-playlist
A YouTube playlist downloader. Requires [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pytube](https://github.com/nficano/pytube) to work.

This script will download the audio of every song in a YouTube playlist and convert the audio to mp3. 

Please let me know if there are any bugs.


This version is heavily inspired by [bgracio](https://github.com/bgracio)([fork](https://github.com/bgracio/yt-playlist)).
